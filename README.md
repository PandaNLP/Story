# The story of PandaNLP

 
This project is derived from my research work. I'm supposed to focus on the study of the detection of sensitive content, but it's hard to get an appropriate dataset for the work. After a long talk with one of my classmates, I decided to create a new dataset for my study work, then open it to my peers who are working on Chinese tasks in the world.
 
The name PandaNLP comes from my hometown and my research work. My hometown is Sichuan province of China. When I was in Germany, there were always some people asking me where you are from. When they get the answer "SiChuan Province of China", the puzzled look always emerges from their lovely faces. Sure, they don't know where Sichuan province is, even I tell them. Suddenly I had an idea for it. They don't know Sichuan province, but they love Pandas. Pandas are the mascot of Sichuan province. They can imagine the hometown of Pandas rather than Sichuan province, so I told them I'm from Sichuan province, the hometown of Pandas. Adding to the study work of NLP, the name PandaNLP comes out of my brain, spontaneously I have it.
